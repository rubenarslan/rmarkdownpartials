For example, you can make enlarge-able plots:

```{r echo=FALSE}
# knitr::opts_knit$set(child = TRUE)
set.seed(1)
```

## Graphical relationship
```{r}
library(rmdpartials)
set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- x + rnorm(100) + 0.5 * x^2
graphics::plot(x, y)
dist <- grDevices::recordPlot() # this actually works much better with ggplot2
```

```{r}
enlarge_plot(dist, large_plot = dist, plot_name = "myplot")
```

## Regression
```{r}
reg <- lm(y ~ x)
regression_diagnostics(reg)
```

## Write a partial on the fly
```{r}
x <- 5
y <- 9
partial(text = "`r x` `r y`")
```


## Debug
Learn about environments in partials.

```{r}
knit_child_debug()
```
